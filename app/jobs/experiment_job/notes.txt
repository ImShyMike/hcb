# Notes on `app/jobs/experiment_job`

Sometimes we want to run experiments in critical or time-sensitive areas of the
codebase. Rather than running the experiment inline (then and there), we can
queue up a job to run the experiment later.

One example use-case are experiments relating to Event balances. Event balances
are time-sensitive as they are used for Stripe Authorization approvals and also
show up on many pages, we wouldn't want to keep the user waiting while we
perform experiments.
