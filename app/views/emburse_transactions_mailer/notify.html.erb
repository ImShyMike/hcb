<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>
  I can't figure out which department this transaction should be associated
  with. You can help me by
  <%= link_to 'clicking here', edit_emburse_transaction_url(@emburse_transaction) %>
  and assigning a department.
</p>

<p>If you ignore this email, you'll also later see this task on the HCB dashboard.</p>

<p>
  Best,<br/>
