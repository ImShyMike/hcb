    We understand there are situations where you need to report a transaction
    (fraud, duplicate, etc.), and weâ€™ve seen that many of these situations
    require nuance and context that only humans can provide. Because of this,
    your request will be sent to a Hack Club Bank staff who will reach out to
    you within 48 business hours.
