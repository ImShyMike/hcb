  Hi there,
</p>

<p>
  Just letting you know that the funds (<strong><%= render_money @transaction.invoice_payout.invoice.item_amount %></strong>) from <%= link_to "a recently paid invoice to
  #{@transaction.invoice_payout.invoice.sponsor.name}", @transaction.invoice_payout.invoice %> have become available within your fund in HCB.
</p>

<p>
  You can now transfer them to your card balance, or leave them in your main account balance. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
</p>

<p>
  Yours truly,<br>
  The HCB Team
