  Hi,
</p>

<p>
  The funds from <%= link_to "a recently paid invoice to
  #{@transaction.invoice_payout.invoice.sponsor.name}", @transaction.invoice_payout.invoice %> have become available within your Hack Club Bank account.
</p>

<p>
  You can now transfer them to Emburse, or leave them in Bank.
  Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
</p>

<p>
Yours truly,<br/>
Hack Club Bank
