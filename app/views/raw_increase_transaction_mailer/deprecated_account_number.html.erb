Hey there,

<br><br>

We're writing because you recently received a <%= render_money @transaction.amount_cents.abs %> <%= @amount.positive? ? "deposit to" : "withdrawal from" %> an old account number for <%= @event.name %> on HCB. As part of a recent change in banking partners, you've been assigned a <%= link_to "new account number", account_number_event_url(@event) %> for receiving payments.

<br><br>

We ask that you make sure to <strong>remove your current bank account information from any external accounts as soon as possible.</strong> Any payments you receive to this account in the future may not be received by HCB. Also, if any of your current donors have your account information, we recommend you reach out to let them know about the change, as well.

<br><br>

You can view your new account details by <%= link_to "clicking here", account_number_event_url(@event) %>. If you have any questions, reach out to us by replying to this email!
