<p>Hi there,</p>

  Your Google Workspace for <strong><%= @g_suite.domain %></strong> is ready to be configured! The next step is to set up the domain's DNS MX records. After that, you'll be able to start creating Google Workspace accounts under the domain for your team.

  Follow the steps <%= link_to 'here on your Google Workspace page', event_g_suite_overview_url(event_id: @g_suite.event.slug) %> to set up your domain for Google Workspace. Please don't hesitate to message us with any questions.
