<p>Hi there, <%= @position.user.first_name %>! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p><%= @changer == @position.user ? "You've" : "#{@changer.name} has" %> changed your role in <%= @position.event.name %>.</p>
<p>Previously, you were a <%= @previous_role %>. <em>Now, you're a <%= @position.role %>.</em></p>

<p>
  This is a
  <%= OrganizerPosition.roles[@previous_role.to_sym] < OrganizerPosition.roles[@position.role.to_sym] ? "higher" : "lower" %>
  level of access than you had before.
  For info on what this change means, please check out
