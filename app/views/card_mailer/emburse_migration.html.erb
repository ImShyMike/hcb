Hey there,

I'm writing you because you have active cards from Hack Club Bank for the following events:
<ul>
<% @events_with_cards.each do |event| %>
  <li><%= event.name %></li>
<% end %>
</ul>

Hack Club Bank is changing card providers soon and our old cards provided by Emburse (the purple ones that say "emburse" on it) will stop working on Sept 15th.
By Sept 15th, you'll be able to issue cards from our new provider (Stripe Issuing) on bank.hackclub.com, but physical cards take time to ship.
We're issuing cards from our new provider now, so they arrive *before* your old cards turn off.

Here are your options:

<ul>
<li>If you need to spend money on a physical card before Oct 1st, just click this link to get your new card issued early:Â <%= link_to @form_link, "this link" %> </li>
<li>If you don't need to spend money on a physical card by Oct 1st, you don't need to do anything.</li>
</ul>
