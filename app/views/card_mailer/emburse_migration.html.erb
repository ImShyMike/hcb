Hey there,

You have active debit cards from <%= link_to 'Hack Club Bank', 'https://bank.hackclub.com' %> for the following projects:
<ul>
<% @events_with_cards.each do |event| %>
  <li><%= event.name %></li>
<% end %>
</ul>

Hack Club Bank is changing card providers soon since the old cards provided by Emburse (the purple ones) will <strong>stop working Sept 15th</strong>.
By Sept 15th, you’ll be able to order cards from our new provider (Stripe Issuing) on bank.hackclub.com,
but since physical cards take time to ship, we’re issuing new cards now so they arrive before your old cards turn off.
<br />
<br />
Here are your options:

<ol>
<li>
  If you need a new physical card to keep spending money with when your Emburse card shuts off, order your new card early:
  <ul>
  <% @form_links.each do |form_link| %>
    <li>
    <%= link_to form_link[:url] do%>
      Order a physical card for <strong><%= form_link[:name] %></strong>
    <% end %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  If you don’t need to spend money via physical card by Oct 1st, you don’t need to do anything.
  On Sept 15th, your Emburse cards will be automatically suspended (you can throw them out)
  and you’ll be able to replace them anytime from your account.
</li>
</ol>

Shipping takes a variable amount of time, so we can only guarantee your new card will arrive before the Emburse shutoff
if you <strong>order the card on or before this Friday</strong> (Sept 4th).
<br />
<br />
The new cards will draw directly from your account balance—no separate card balances & transfers—and work better in a bunch of other ways.
If you’re curious about why we’re switching off Emburse, <%= link_to 'read about the change here', 'https://headwayapp.co/bank-changelog/moving-to-a-new-card-provider-166871' %>.
