  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Hey, Bankers! üëã From logos to phrasing, we want to make sure you and your team feel confident sharing about Hack Club on your site, fundraising platforms, grant apps, and other online spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    We know you‚Äôre eager to share about your nonprofit status through Hack Club Bank. ü§ó Following brand guidelines will not only help you display an accurate relationship with Hack Club but will also help create a unified appearance amongst all fiscally sponsored projects and legitimize your status.
