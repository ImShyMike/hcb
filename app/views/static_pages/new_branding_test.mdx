# Brand Guidelines

## Overview

Hey, Bankers! üëãFrom logos to phrasing, we want to make sure you and your team feel confident sharing about Hack Club on your site, fundraising platforms, grant apps, and other online spaces.

We know you‚Äôre eager to share about your nonprofit status through Hack Club Bank. ü§ó Following brand guidelines will not only help you display an accurate relationship with Hack Club but will also help create a unified appearance amongst all fiscally sponsored projects and legitimize your status.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
	Jump to the [fiscal sponsorship](#fiscal-sponsorship) section to see how you
	can accurately represent your 501(c)(3) status.
</Callout>

## Our Name

When using our name, please make sure to:

-   Capitalize the first letter of each word (e.g. Hack Club Bank)
-   Refrain from adding/removing additional characters (e.g. ‚ÄòHackClubBank‚Äô)

### Acceptable abbreviations of "Hack Club Bank"

You may have seen our team use these references, and if ‚ÄúHack Club Bank‚Äù becomes a mouthful, feel free to use them too.

-   The acronym ‚ÄúHCB‚Äù
-   ‚ÄúBank,‚Äù making sure the first letter is capitalized

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
	We recommend including the full name at least once before `HCB` or `Bank` to
	make the most sense grammatically.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
	As a reminder, Hack Club Bank is not an actual bank! We are a fiscal
	sponsorship platform backed on First Republic Bank, Bank of America, and
	Increase. When you sign the fiscal sponsorship agreement, a ‚Äúrestricted
	fund‚Äù ‚Äì a privatized section of these bank accounts for your team only ‚Äì is
	created for your organization through our platform.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
	When using Hack Club Bank in legal settings, use `Hack Club Bank, a project
	by The Hack Foundation (d.b.a. Hack Club)` OR `The Hack Foundation (d.b.a.
	Hack Club)`. Make sure not to abbreviate or shorten the name in this
	context.
</Callout>

### Fiscal Sponsorship

As an event or organization fiscally sponsored through HCB, the following can be included on any correspondence, websites, marketing, etc.:

`[YOUR PROJECT NAME] is fiscally sponsored by Hack Club Bank, a project by The Hack Foundation (d.b.a. Hack Club), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit (EIN: 81-2908499).`

If you‚Äôd like to modify the above statement, make sure it clearly shares that you're fiscally sponsored by HCB. If you have questions or would like to run your phrasing by us, feel free to [contact the Bank team](mailto:bank@hackclub.com).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
	Fiscal sponsor ‚â† sponsor or donor. Unless you have received direct financial
	support from us, please do NOT use this reference as your organization's
	relationship to HCB.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
	Misrepresenting your relationship with HCB or Hack Club could result in the
	termination of your fiscal sponsorship agreement.
</Callout>
