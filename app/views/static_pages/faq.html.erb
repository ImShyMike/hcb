        </summary>
        <article>
          <p>
          Yes! Hack Club Bank started as a tool for hackathon organizers, but today, we support
          a spectrum of events related to science, technology, and entrepreneurship education. Chances are,
          you’ll be able to use Hack Club Bank!

        </summary>
        <article>
          <p>
          Hack Club Bank accepts paper checks! Just mail the check to our billing address,
          <strong>The Hack Foundation, 8605 Santa Monica Blvd #86294, West Hollywood, CA 90069</strong>. Be sure to label
          the envelope or the check’s memo with the name of your event or organization, so we can make sure
          that you receive the funds. However, the check itself <strong>must be addressed to "The Hack Foundation"</strong> for us to
          be able to deposit checks to Hack Club Bank.

          <h3 class="inline mb1">What do I do if I lost my Hack Club Bank card, it got stolen, or it expires?</h3>
        </summary>
        <article>
          <p>
          If your card is lost or stolen, we can de-activate the card and order you a new one. Please get in touch with
          the Bank team as soon as possible. If your card expires, you can de-activate the card and issue yourself
          a new card through the Hack Club Bank dashboard—Hack Club Bank cards do not auto-renew when they pass the expiry date.

          <h3 class="inline mb1">I keep getting emails about uploading receipts when I use a card. Do I have to upload receipts?</h3>
        </summary>
        <article>
          <p>
          Yes, please. One of the parts of being a legally responsible nonprofit is keeping good record of our expenses
          and where our funds are spent for ourselves, and for the government in case of audits. Your receipts serve
          as proof of the purchases you’ve made on behalf of your project, event, or Hack Club, and helps Hack Club Bank
          stay compliant and continue helping support all our customers.

            Our sponsor wants to pay through Bill.com / something other than invoices through Stripe.

          <p>
          We can accommodate whichever method the sponsor would like to use, including
          proprietary "supplier systems" that larger companies may use to pay their bills.
          These methods usually require that they connect and pay directly to Hack Club Bank’s
          underlying bank account (not Stripe’s invoicing system), so please contact the Bank team
          to start this process.

          <h3 class="inline mb1">Can we change the name or G Suite domain of our event / project?</h3>
        </summary>
        <article>
          <p>
          Yes, you’re not locked into the name or G Suite domain you used to set up your Hack Club Bank account.
          However, currently, changing your project name is a fairly involved process on our backend,
          so you’re only able to change your name up to twice every year. If you need to change your name or domain
          more frequently, please contact the Bank team.
