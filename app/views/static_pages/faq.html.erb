          Yes! Hack Club Bank started as a tool for hackathon organizers, but
          today we work with a spectrum of events, projects, and
          organizations related to science, technology, entrepreneurship, and
          education. Chances are, you’ll be eligible to use Bank!

        <article>
          <p>
            Hack Club Bank accepts paper checks! Just mail the check to our
            billing address:
          </p>
          <code>

The Hack Foundation

          <p>
            Be sure that your organization's name is included either on the
            check's memo or somewhere else in or on the envelope sent.
            Without it, we can't properly route received funds.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Checks must be made out to either "The Hack Foundation"
            or "Hack Club".</strong> Silicon Valley Bank, our banking
            partner, unfortunately rejects checks made out to any name
            besides those two.

          Hack Club Bank’s 501(c)(3) nonprofit status comes from <a

          registered as The Hack Foundation. Our EIN, which is the same as
          our tax ID, is <code>81-2908499</code>. It is also available at the

        <article>
          <p>
          If your card is lost or stolen, we can deactivate the card. Please
          get in touch with the Bank team
          <% if organizer_signed_in? %>
            (<%= help_message %>)
          <% else %>
            <span class="muted">(sign in to view)</span>
          <% end%>
          as soon as possible. In the meantime, please freeze your
          card within the Hack Club Bank dashboard. If your card
          expires, you can freeze the card and issue yourself a new
          card through the Hack Club Bank dashboard—Hack Club Bank
          cards do not auto-renew when they pass their expiry date.

          <h3 class="inline mb1">I keep getting emails about uploading receipts when I make a purchase using a card. Do I have to upload receipts?</h3>
        </summary>
        <article>
          <p>
          Yes. The IRS requires all nonprofits to keep receipts for
          transactions on file. Additionally, nonprofits following best
          practices hire auditors to ensure their books are compliant.
          Missing receipts lead to failed audits.
          </p>
          <p>
          Continually not uploading receipts for purchases is grounds for
          termination of fiscal sponsorship, as it puts the 501(c)(3) status
          of Hack Club and everyone else partnering with Hack Club Bank at
          risk.

          We can accommodate whichever method the supporter would like to
          use, including proprietary "supplier systems" that larger companies
          may use to pay their bills. These methods usually require that they
          connect and pay directly to Hack Club Bank’s underlying bank
          account (not Stripe’s invoicing system), so please contact the Bank
          team

          <p>
          Yes, you’re not locked into the name or Google Workspace domain you
          used to set up your Hack Club Bank account. However, currently,
          changing your project name is a fairly involved process on our
          backend, so you’re only able to change your name up to twice every
          year. If you need to change your name or domain more frequently,
          please contact the Bank team.
