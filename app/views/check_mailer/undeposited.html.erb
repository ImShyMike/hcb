<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>
  Just wanted to give you a quick heads up that we're voiding <%= link_to @check, "Check ##{@check.check_number}" %> because it hasn't been cashed since a month after issuing.
</p>

<p>
	I've sent the <%= @check.event.name %> team an email about this, however you may want to contact the lead organizer and give a second heads up. You'll see a request to transfer money back in the Bank dashboard shortly.
</p>

<p>
  Best,<br/>
