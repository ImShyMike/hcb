<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>
  Just wanted to give you a quick heads up that we're voiding <%= link_to "Check ##{@check.check_number}", @check %> because it hasn't been cashed for a month after we sent it.
</p>

<p>
  I've sent the <%= @check.event.name %> team an email about this, however you may want to contact the lead organizer and give a second heads up. You'll see a request to transfer money back in the Bank dashboard shortly.
</p>

<p>
  Best,<br>
