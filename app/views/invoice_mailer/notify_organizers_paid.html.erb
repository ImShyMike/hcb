  Hi there,
</p>

<p>
  The funds from <%= link_to "a recently paid invoice to #{@invoice.sponsor.name}", @invoice %>
  <% if can_front_balance %>
    have transferred
    <% else %>
    are transferring
  <% end %>
  into <%= link_to @invoice.sponsor.event.name, @invoice.sponsor.event %> on HCB.
</p>

<p>
  <% if can_front_balance %>
      The funds (<strong><%= render_money @invoice.local_hcb_code.amount %></strong>) are now available to spend.
  <% else %>
    The funds (<strong><%= render_money @invoice.local_hcb_code.amount %></strong>) will be available on approximately <strong><%= @invoice.payout.arrival_date.to_date %></strong>.
  <% end %>
  Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions!
</p>

<% unless @invoice.local_hcb_code.amount_cents == @invoice.item_amount %>
  <p>
    <%= @invoice.sponsor.name %> sent <%= render_money @invoice.item_amount - @invoice.local_hcb_code.amount_cents %> less than they were invoiced for. Please reach out to them to collect the remaining balance via a new invoice.
