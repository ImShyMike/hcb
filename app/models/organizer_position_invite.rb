# OrganizerPositionInvites are used to invite users - whether they already
# exist or not - to manage an Event.
#
# One of the oddities we need to deal with is that the User being invited will
# usually not already exist in the database. Here's how we're dealing with it.
#
# Scenario 1: User being invited does not exist in the database
#
#  1. OrganizerPositionInvite is created. Event and email are set, user is not.
#  2. Notification email is sent to invitee
#  3. Invitee goes to bank and logs in for the first time, creating a record for
#     a User with their email in the database
#  4. When the User is first created, a trigger in User is called that searches
#     for any OrganizerPositionInvites with an email match that don't yet have
#     an associated User and associates them
#
# Scenario 2: User being invited exists in the database
#
#  1. OrganizerPositionInvite is created. Event, email, and user all get set on
#     creation.
