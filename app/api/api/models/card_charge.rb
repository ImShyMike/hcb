    # Card Charges are not an actual linked object within the transaction
    # engine. It's pretty messy. In the TX engine, they're represented with:
    # - StripeAuthorization
    # - RawPendingStripeTransaction
    # - RawStripeTransaction
    #
    # and accessed via HcbCode using:
    # - HashedTransaction
    # - CanonicalTransaction
    # - CanonicalPendingTransaction
    #
    # There isn't a great Model for representing Card Charges. However, since
    # HcbCodes have easy access to all the card charge data, we'll be using
    # HcbCodes to represent Card Charges in the API.
    #
    # This class is an ActiveRecord model and inherits from HcbCode. This
    # definitely feels pretty hacky, but it seems to be the simplest way to give
    # card charges their own public ID and to have "stricter" types. I've tried
    # my best to prevent database modifications by this CardCharge model.
