# Bank

Bank is a tool for hackers to hack on the real world, like GitHub, but for building with atoms and people, not bits and cycles.

## Getting Started with GitHub Codespaces
We're currently testing running the Hack Club Bank development environment in GitHub Codespaces. GitHub Codespaces come with the prerequisites preinstalled, allow for installation of packages without modifying your main system, allow for multiple instances, create a overall a streamlined and repeatable environment, and let anyone with internet & browser or VS Code access to contribute.

Assuming a successful testing phase, this will be the prefered method of running a development version of Bank.

Instructions on how to setup can be found [here](/codespace-step.md.). Premade `codespace-config.sh` and `codespace-start.sh` scripts exist for configuring the environment and starting instances.

## Getting Started Locally

Install [dotenv/cli](https://github.com/dotenv-org/cli)

```bash
npm install @dotenv/cli -g
```

And load the latest .env file to your local machine.

```bash
dotenv-cli pull
```

Install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)

```bash
brew install rbenv
```

Install [bundler](https://bundler.io/)

```bash
gem install bundler -v 1.17.3
```

Run bundler

```bash
bundle install
```

Install yarn dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Create and migrate database

```bash
bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:migrate
```

Populate the database

```bash
heroku git:remote -a bank-hackclub # if your repo isn't attached to the heroku app
heroku pg:backups:capture
heroku pg:backups:download # will save as latest.dump, double check to make sure that file is created
pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -d bank_development latest.dump
```

Run the application

```bash
bin/rails s
```

## Additional Installs

Install wkhtmltopdf

```bash
brew install wkhtmltopdf
```

Browse to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Alternative with Docker

Copy .env file

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
```

Run Docker

```bash
env $(cat .env.docker) docker-compose build
env $(cat .env.docker) docker-compose run --service-ports web bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate
env $(cat .env.docker) docker-compose run --service-ports web bundle exec rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
```

## Heroku tasks

We currently have the following buildpacks:

```
‚ùØ heroku buildpacks
=== bank-hackclub Buildpack URLs
1. https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt
2. https://github.com/evantahler/heroku-buildpack-notify-slack-deploy.git
3. heroku/nodejs
4. heroku/ruby
```

The apt buildpack works in conjunction with the local Aptfile in order to install poppler-utils. Poppler-utils helps generate preview thumbnails of documents.

## Admin tasks

### Import database dump from Heroku

```
$ heroku git:remote -a bank-hackclub # if your repo isn't attached to the heroku app
$ heroku pg:backups:capture
$ heroku pg:backups:download # will save as latest.dump, double check to make sure that file is created
$ docker-compose run --service-ports web /bin/bash # enter the docker container, which includes pg_restore pre-installed
$ pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h db -U postgres -d bank_development latest.dump
```

### Running migrations

Currently, migrations are decoupled from deployments. After deploying a patch with a new migration, run:

```
$ heroku run /bin/bash -a bank-hackclub
$ rails db:migrate:status
$ rails db:migrate
```

### Running tests

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```

### Log into the Rails console in production

```
heroku console -a bank-hackclub
```

We can also replace `bank-hackclub` with any other app name (like a review app) to get the console for that app instead.

### Restart periodic / repeating jobs

For example, for the `SyncTransactionsJob`:

```
SyncTransactionsJob.perform_now(repeat: true)
```

## Internal API for operations (clubs) integration

These APIs are not public, but have a reasonable expectation of stability because the Hack Club clubs team integrates with various Bank facilities through these JSON endpoints. They're oriented around three use cases:

1. Send money to a student to spend on a project
   - Student either specifies a Bank event, or we create one for them
   - We disburse funds to that event
2. Send money to a club or event
   - We find out their bank event slug (probably referencing Slack / Airtable, which happens outside of Bank)
   - We disburse funds to that event

So to make this possible, the Bank API currently supports three actions:

1. Check if an event with given slug exists
2. Create an event with given organizer emails
3. Schedule a disbursement of grants to a given event

### Authentication

Because Bank currently uses auth through `hackclub/api` which doesn't support bot authentication and tokens, we auth with a hard-coded string key. Get this key from a Bank developer, and in JSON requests, include the key as a `token`.

### Creating events

#### `GET /api/v1/events/find`

Request should have parameters:

```
slug: <string>
```

Response will be of shape:

```
HTTP 200
{
    name: <string>,
    organizer_emails: Array<string>,
    total_balance: <number>,
}
```

or

```
HTTP 404
```

`total_balance` will be the sum of their account and card balances, in dollars.

#### `POST /api/v1/events`

Request should be of shape:

```
{
    name: <string>,
    slug: <string>, [optional]
    organizer_emails: Array<string>,
}
```

`slug` is optional. If no `slug` is provided, we'll take the name and attempt to sluggify it. Events created this way will be `unapproved`.

Response will be of shape:

```
HTTP 201
{
    name: <string>,
    slug: <string>,
    organizer_emails: Array<string>,
}
```

or an error of type 400 (invalid input). If a successful response (201), no fields will be missing.

### Requesting disbursements

Disbursements are executed using the `Disbursement` model / system within Hack Club Bank.

#### `POST /api/v1/disbursements`

Disbursements take money out of one HCB event and into another HCB event, for example from the `hq` event into the `hackpenn` event. In this case, the `source_event_slug` is `hq` and `destination_event_slug` is `hackpenn`.

You can view all past and pending disbursements at `/disbursements`.

Request should be of shape:

```
{
    source_event_slug: <string>,
    destination_event_slug: <string>,
    amount: <number>,
    name: <string>,
}
```

Amount is in dollars in decimals, name is the name of the disbursement / grant. For example, a sensible `name` could be `GitHub Grant`. This name will be shown to Bank users.

Response will be of shape:

```
HTTP 201
{
    source_event_slug: <string>,
    destination_event_slug: <string>,
    amount: <number>,
    name: <string>,
}
```

or one of

```
HTTP 404 - no event with that slug was found
HTTP 400 - generic invalid input
```

If a `201` response, all fields will always be present.

## Events

```
settledTransactionCreated
pendingTransactionCreated
```
