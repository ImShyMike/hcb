  <h1>HCB</h1>
  <strong>A powerful, safe, and easy-to-use fiscal sponsorship platform for Hack Clubs, hackathons, and nonprofits.</strong>
</div>
<br>

Welcome to the [HCB](https://hackclub.com/hcb/) codebase. We are so excited to have you. With your help, we can make HCB the best platform to run a nonprofit.

## What is HCB?

HCB is a platform for managing your nonprofit's finances. Through HCB, you can get a 501(c)(3) status-backed restricted fund for your project and manage your finances through an intuitive web interface.

## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to HCB! Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/hackclub/hcb/wiki) for more information on how to get started.

All contributors are expected to follow the Hack Club [Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct).

## Quick Start

This section provides a high-level quick start guide for running HCB with Docker or GitHub Codespaces. <!--For more information, please see the [wiki page](https://github.com/hackclub/hcb/wiki/Development).-->

Clone the repository or create a new Codespaces instance.

```bash
# skip this step if you're using Codespaces
git clone https://github.com/hackclub/hcb.git && cd hcb
```

Install and run [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Run the [docker_dev_setup.sh](./docker_dev_setup.sh) script to install dependencies and set up a local environment with Docker.

```bash
./docker_dev_setup.sh
```

Start the development server with `./docker_start.sh`

Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

<!--**What's Solargraph?** [Solargraph](https://solargraph.org/) is a Ruby language server that provides better Intellisense and code completion. It's completely optional to use Solargraph but highly recommended. You may also need to install the [Solargraph extension](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph#using-solargraph) for your IDE.-->

### Production Access

We've transitioned to using development keys and seed data in development, but historically have used production keys and data on dev machines. It is recommended to not roll back to using production data & keys in development, but if absolutely necessary the following steps can be taken:

- Set environment variable `USE_PROD_CREDENTIALS=true` in your docker container (usually via `.env.development`). N.B. this does not set [`RAILS_ENV=production`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#rails-environment-settings), which you should **never** do on a development machine.
- Put the production key in `config/credentials/production.key`. If you have heroku access you can get this from the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable. If not then ask a team member (ping `@creds` in Slack). [DO NOT CHECK THIS INTO GIT](https://github.com/hackclub/hcb/blob/99fab73deb27a09a9424847e02080cb3ea5d09cf/.gitignore#L29)
    - If you need to edit [`config/credentials/production.yml.enc`](./config/credentials/production.yml.enc), you can now run `bin/rails credentials:edit --environment=production`.
- Run the [docker_setup.sh](./docker_setup.sh) script to set up a local environment with Docker using a dump of the production database.

Developing with production keys & data has risk and should only be used if you know what you are doing.

## Deployment

Pushes to the `main` branch are automatically deployed by Heroku.

## Developer Documentation

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/hackclub/hcb/wiki) for technical documentation on HCB.
