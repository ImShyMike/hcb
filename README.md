## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to Hack Club Bank! Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/hackclub/bank/wiki) for more information on how to get started.

All contributors are expected to follow the Hack Club [Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct).

## Quick Start

This section provides a high-level quick start guide for running Bank with Docker or GitHub Codespaces. For more information, please see the [wiki page](https://github.com/hackclub/bank/wiki/Development).

Clone the repository or create a new Codespaces instance.

```bash
# skip this step if you're using Codespaces
git clone https://github.com/hackclub/bank.git && cd bank
```

Run the [docker_setup.sh](./docker_setup.sh) script to install dependencies and set up a local environment with Docker.

```bash
./docker_setup.sh
# optionally, append the --with-solargraph flag to enable Solargraph
./docker_setup.sh --with-solargraph
```

Start the development server with the [docker_start.sh](./docker_start.sh) script.

```bash
./docker_start.sh
# optionally, append the --with-solargraph flag to start Solargraph
./docker_start.sh --with-solargraph
```

Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

**What's Solargraph?** [Solargraph](https://solargraph.org/) is a Ruby language server that provides better Intellisense and code completion. It's completely optional to use Solargraph but highly recommended. You may also need to install the [Solargraph extension](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph#using-solargraph) for your IDE.
