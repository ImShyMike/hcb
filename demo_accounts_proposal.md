How do I track what a demo account is?

**The Utopian future**

- Users individually sign contracts
- Contracts are just for creating accounts– you can still invite a team member who doesn’t have a contract
- You can signup without a contract, but an account isn’t active until at least 1 contract-signed users are onboard

**The MVP**

- [ ] Users can signup without a contract & create an account
	- [x] Limited to 2 accounts
- [ ] Contractless accounts (“demo mode”) just for FIRST teams
	- [ ] Endpoint for creating accounts
	- [x] Shows “demo mode” on settings page
	- [ ] No transparency mode
	- [ ] No donation page
	- [ ] No invoicing (or anything on "send/transfers" page)
	- [ ] No perks
	- [ ] No physical card issuing
	- [ ] Virtual card issuing is limited to 2 per team
		- [ ] No card info revealed
	- [x] Have a CTA for signing a contract on top of each page
