Hey all! It's been a while since I've posted here (we are still working on bank features-- most of it just hasn't been technical changes).

I'm happy to announce that **you can now get login codes for Hack Club Bank via SMS**

Users in an organization with "Beta features enabled" (in the organization settings) will have access to the feature now, and all users will have access soon.

I hate passwords. I can never [remember them when I need them](https://xkcd.com/936/), each new account I create means another ['unique' password](https://xkcd.com/792/), and [people are great at leaking them](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hunter2). We _really_ don't want to burden everyone with all that just to access their financial platform, so Hack Club Bank has never used passwords.
